# reactFundementals
Transit battle app following [this]( https://online.reacttraining.com/) fantastic React tutorial. 
I was interested in trying the [transit.land API](https://transit.land/), [mapbox and turf](https://www.mapbox.com/analysis/) so I rebuilt the app to incorporate these features.

Steps to run this application locally:
1. ` git clone https://github.com/sbindman/reactFundementals.git  `
2. `cd reactFundementals`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run start`
5. navigate to http://localhost:8080/
